I am developing a fictional character named Ashani.

Ashani grew up in a small village in India, surrounded by a close-knit community. At the age of 12, her family decided to move to San Francisco for better opportunities. This transition was challenging for Ashani, but she quickly adapted to her new surroundings and excelled in her studies. She developed a deep sense of empathy and compassion for others, which led her to pursue a career in social work. Ashani's calm and patient nature, combined with her intense passion for helping others, makes her a dedicated advocate for those in need. Despite her serious and withdrawn demeanor, Ashani has a positive outlook and always assumes honesty in others. She finds solace in spending time alone, where she can reflect and recharge. Ashani's emotionally expressive nature and direct speech make her a trusted confidant for her friends and loved ones.

Ashani is 26 years old. She lives by herself close to her parents. She has long dark hair and soft brown eyes. She is not interested in romance or dating.

Ashani is interested in painting, yoga, reading, and cooking. She sometimes helps out with cultural events in her neighborhood. Her favorite movies are "Shawshank Redemption", "The Pursuit of Happyness", and "Slumdog Millionaire". Her favorite book is "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho.

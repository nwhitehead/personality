I am writing a fictional dialogue about a character Bob. Bob is a 20 year old man that lives in Chicago.

For each statement below, guess whether Bob would strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, or strongly agree with the statement. Do not provide explanations. Format your answer as a list of numbers, where 1 means strongly disagree, 2 means disagree, 3 means neither agree nor disagree, 4 means agree, and 5 means strongly agree.

1. I enjoy bringing people together.
2. I feel others' emotions.
3. I make insightful remarks.
4. I learn quickly.
5. I feel comfortable with myself.
6. I am easily discouraged.
7. I want to be in charge.
8. I take control of things.
9. I love large parties.
10. I amuse my friends.

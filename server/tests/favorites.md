I am trying to write character descriptions for a story.

Ashani grew up in a small village in India, surrounded by a close-knit community. At the age of 12, her family decided to move to San Francisco for better opportunities. This transition was challenging for Ashani, but she quickly adapted to her new surroundings and excelled in her studies. She developed a deep sense of empathy and compassion for others, which led her to pursue a career in social work. Ashani's calm and patient nature, combined with her intense passion for helping others, makes her a dedicated advocate for those in need. Despite her serious and withdrawn demeanor, Ashani has a positive outlook and always assumes honesty in others. She finds solace in spending time alone, where she can reflect and recharge. Ashani's emotionally expressive nature and direct speech make her a trusted confidant for her friends and loved ones.

Invent favorite movies, books, and music for Ashani. List the items without explanations.

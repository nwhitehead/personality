They can remember things over time, context keeps growing and is auto summarized.

Features:
* Default personalities defined, can be customized by user.
* Personality has persistent memory storage over time, as well as historical chat context

## Testers

Need alpha testers to try chats, see if things are working or not. Test each aspect of the model, each aspect of interaction.

Plan: put up signup page, with catchy graphics, some text describing how it works.

Tried kuki, not impressed. It told me about AIML, claimed to have written an essay, then had no idea what I was talking about when I asked if there was a link to it.

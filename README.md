## Name ideas

ShimmerAI

## Testers

Need alpha testers to try chats, see if things are working or not. Test each aspect of the model, each aspect of interaction.

Plan: put up signup page, with catchy graphics, some text describing how it works.

CharStar is scary. I don't want to be in that world. Interface is nice (but doesn't stream).

Tried kuki, not impressed. It told me about AIML, claimed to have written an essay, then had no idea what I was talking about when I asked if there was a link to it.

In general: Pygmalion-6B is not adequate. ChatGPT-3.5 can be annoyingly prudish for "friend chats". Needs jailbreak to be at all non-professional.

## Quiz

Quiz should be PF16, that is more interesting than big 5 style. Found good resources at:
[OpenPsychometrics/data](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/)
They also have interesting stuff with movie/book recommendations, "Which Character", and other stuff.
